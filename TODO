To Do
- shear flow boundary 2D/3D
- velocity boundary 2D/3D
- use Boundaries in 3D
- not calculate Gradient every time 2D/3D
- apply more correct velocity measurement to 3D
- centering in preprocess
- initialize shear flow 3D
- analyze lateral Bubble motion 3D
- use shear rate in main.cc

Done
- Param log as CSV
- Test alternative ways to determine velocities
- initialize shear flow 2D
- update preprocessFile in /example
- fix numOfthreads in all cases
- fixed cut-out 3D
- write proper CSV files
- update makefile for /translate
- analyze bubble position 2D / 3D
- analyze lateral Bubble motion 2D
- C++11 in anderen Makefiles hinzuf√ºgen
- find indices of bubble Cells 
- cut and paste Cells from one Lattice to another 
- process warnings
- enable shear flow in Preprocessfile (shear rate)
- correct DimSet to int arrays
